To install, follow these instructions:

    1. Create a database on your server / web hosting package. UserFrosting supports MySQLi and requires MySQL server version 4.1.3 or newer, as well as PHP 5.4 or later with PDO database connections enabled.
    2. Open up models/db-settings.php and fill out the connection details for your database.
    3. Run the UserFrosting installer at install/install.php. UserFrosting will attempt to build the database for you.
    4. After the installer successfully completes, delete the install folder.
    5. Register your admin account, which will by default be the first account that is registered.
